              Hello I am Scott Speheger, I teach Physical Education and Health
              Education at Lincoln Middle High School. This is my first year at
              the school and I could not be happier to be here. I am the Varsity
              Girls Basketball Coach at Lincoln as well. My wife and my two
              daughters moved down with me from West Lafayette to join this new
              chapter in my life. If any one has an interesting story that you
              would like us to feature please reach out.

              Hi, I’m Adrian Bussen! I’m totally obsessed with writing and
              finding magic in the little things that make life sweet. Sometimes
              I feel like “I remember it all too well”—all the tiny moments that
              matter most. Basically, I live for words, daydreams, and those
              small, perfect details that make everything feel kinda sparkly. ✨

              Hello my name is Madie Glover, I'm a freshman at Lincoln Middle
              High School. For my school sport I do cheerleading. For fun I like
              to ride my horse Dakota or spend time with my family and friends.
